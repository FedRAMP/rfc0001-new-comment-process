# A New Comment Process for FedRAMP

- Status: Demo
- Created By: FedRAMP
- Start Date: 2024-11-01
- Closing Date: 2024-12-31
- Short Name: rfc0001-new-comment-process

**Where to Comment:**

- Discussion Forum:
  https://github.com/FedRAMP/rfc0001-new-comment-process/discussions
- Public Comment Spreadsheet: _pending_
- Email: info@fedramp.gov with the subject "RFC 0001 Feedback"

## Summary

We are piloting the use of GitHub to host focused discussions and public comment
on FedRAMP changes that will affect cloud service providers. We will use the
process for at least five engagements before reviewing its effectiveness, but
will seek to improve the process continuously based on feedback.

## Motivation

Commenting on FedRAMP changes shouldnâ€™t feel like sending a letter into a black
box. As we explored ways to solve this we revisited an old idea to use GitHub
and treat policy as code. Folks have expressed initial support for this idea in
small group discussions, so we're testing it out to understand how effective
this method will be compared to just asking folks to fill out a spreadsheet.

The best way to test a new option for public comment is likely just to request
comment, so here we are!

## Explanation

_From [the main README](../README.md):_

The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) intends to
engage continuously and iteratively with our stakeholders. This repository will
be used as an ongoing digital meeting place for us hear your experiences and
perspectives.

All FedRAMP RFCs are open to responses from the public and government, including
representatives from cloud service providers, third party indepent assessment
organizations, federal agencies, industry organizations, or individuals with an
interest in cybersecurity and cloud services.

All RFCs will provide alternate methods for providing comments for folks who are
unfamiliar with github or would simply prefer to submit comments in a different
way.

### How will FedRAMP request comments?

FedRAMP will create a fork of this repo to initiate an RFC for specific topics.
All discussion and participation will take place in the fork, with the outcome
merged into this repo when the RFC is closed.

The forked repo will have [Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions)
enabled and stakeholders are encouraged to create new discussions with your
feedback and interact with feedback provided by others. The FedRAMP team may
seek clarification or participate in the discussion as appropriate, and may
close discussions that have run their course after review.

FedRAMP will communicate to the public about open RFCs via its various social
channels, including blogs, email lists, and more. Multiple RFCs may be run
simultaneously by the team, and the
[status of all RFCs can be seen here](rfc/README.md).

#### Providing feedback

There are multiple ways to provide feedback on a full RFC:

- Participate in the Discussion

- Suggest changes to a document by opening a pull request (you will need to fork
  this repo first). The pull request must suggest one or more changes and
  describe the rationale for the change(s).

- Follow the instructions in the RFC to use alternative mechanisms for public
  feedback, such as on-line forms or email.

It is important that each bit of feedback is _concise_ and _actionable_,
providing enough information to allow the document maintainers to adequately
address the feedback.

> **Please follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) at all times!**

#### How FedRAMP will participate

This engagement process is a feedback cycle, where discussion drives changes and
further discussion. During the public comment period, the following will occur
as a cycle:

1. **Feedback and Discussion**

   - Engagement between FedRAMP authors and commenters, with responses to
     feedback.

2. **Continuous Revision**
   - FedRAMP authors will review and decide to accept or reject the feedback,
     making appropriate edits.

The end of the public comment period **does not mean the policy will be
immediately implemented.** Other governance activities and final approval will
be required; when ready for adoption or publication, final policies or documents
will be widely shared publicly with appropriate implementation activities.

_Currently, only members of the FedRAMP team can initiate the formal RFC
process._

### Why should I submit RFC feedback?

FedRAMP stakeholders, including cloud service providers (CSPs), security
professionals, government agencies, and industry experts, may provide public
feedback on these documents for several key reasons:

- Influencing Policy and Framework Development: FedRAMP documents, such as
  updates to security guidelines, assessment frameworks, or requirements impact
  stakeholders directly. By providing feedback, stakeholders have an opportunity
  to shape the policies to ensure they are practical, effective, and align with
  industry standards. This can help ensure that the requirements and guidelines
  are feasible for implementation and improve overall security.

- Addressing Practical Implementation Challenges: Stakeholders who are directly
  involved in the FedRAMP authorization or in the process of securing federal
  could use may experience unanticipated practical challenges. Public feedback
  allows these stakeholders to highlight real-world issues, propose solutions,
  and ensure that policies are aligned with technological trends and operational
  realities.

- Advocating for Cost-Effectiveness and Efficiency: Cloud service providers and
  other affected parties are often concerned about the costs and administrative
  burden associated with meeting FedRAMP requirement. Providing feedback allows
  stakeholders to advocate for streamlined processes, suggest more efficient
  frameworks, or raise concerns about requirements that might be too expensive
  or complex.

- Ensuring Transparency and Accountability: Public feedback fosters an open
  dialogue between the government and industry. It promotes transparency and
  ensures that stakeholders are part of the decision-making process. This
  collaboration helps build trust between federal agencies and private sector
  participants and ensures that the government remains accountable for
  considering diverse perspectives.

- Mitigating Security Risks: Security professionals may provide feedback to
  ensure that FedRAMP security guidelines are rigorous enough to mitigate
  evolving cybersecurity threats. Their insights help ensure that the
  government's security posture remains up-to-date and effective in protecting
  sensitive data.

- Encouraging Innovation: By participating in the public feedback process,
  stakeholders can propose innovative approaches, highlight emerging
  technologies, and suggest ways to incorporate these into the FedRAMP program.
  This ensures that the program remains adaptive to the fast-paced evolution of
  cloud technologies.

Ultimately, public feedback helps ensure that FedRAMP documents and policies
reflect the needs and expertise of both government and private sector entities,
fostering a more secure, efficient, and collaborative cloud security
environment.

## Discussion Requested

FedRAMP would like to understand how stakeholders would engage in GitHub
Discussions in response to requests like this and if the alternatives are
sufficient for folks that aren't familiar with this type of discussion. How can
we improve this experience?

We would also like to understand other priority issues that are on folks' minds
that we might pursue for comment next.
